### Overview
Project 3 for Interaction Design course at the University of San Francisco. This project is about speculative technology - Dating Simulator. Player is in the 'virtual world' and gets theirs random matches, and chave choice to interact/chat with them. Everything depends of what they will answer and what rating they will going to get. I made sure its very clear and as easy and possible to navigate around project.
